# go-psychic-poker
Implementation of https://github.com/btccom/Hire/blob/master/exercise/psychic-poker-en.md

WIP

Implemented as a command line application, where you can either type input (keyboard) or pipe in an input file. 


Build instructions:
* WIP

This does not implement: 
* Checking whether cards are duplicate
* Showing the cards of the best hand in the output
* Calculating and displaying detailed rank/scoring 
* Does not fail gracefully, anything outside of the spec will panic (fail early)

QA:
 * NUnit tests WIP
 * No manual verification tests
 * No code reviews 
 * Not validated
 * No usability tests
